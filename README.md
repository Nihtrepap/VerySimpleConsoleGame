# VerySimpleConsoleGame
Just wanted to make a simple console game

You are the humble letter A and wants to save all your humble letter B friends.
But be aware of all the not so humble X letters. They can spawn anywhere on B on A, yeah
everywhere so watch out.

How to play:
**The game will update as soon as you move A, so if you have taken B dont freeze just keep moving**

Use WASD to move around.

You cant hold in the keys to play, you click them. So click fast.

If you have to get on letter X you will loose points, so dont enter X unless needed.

The walls are your friends. Dont seem to be able to go around? Use the walls, they teleport 
you to the opposite side.

Why click fast? Well you will get more points the faster you gather up the humble letter B and get over 50 points !

One last thing, you have life points in the shape of hearts. 
Im sure you can guess what happens if there are no hearts left...

Good luck out there.
